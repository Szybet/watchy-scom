### Supported by:
- https://github.com/Szybet/InkWatchy

### Why
I'm lazy. [Again](https://github.com/Szybet/kobo-screen-mirror)

### Some notes
- Works best with a external USB-UART adapter. Best speeds but the one on the watchy should work too
- **Works without a screen!**
- You can open the image in kolourpaint now to inspect invidual pixels, with one click!
- The delay is minimal, look at the demo :D
